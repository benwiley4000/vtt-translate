# vtt-translate

Not exactly the best idea...

...but you can use this to Google Translate your .vtt subtitle files into other languages!

## install

TODO: publish to npm when finalized and replace with npm registry install instructions

0. Install Node.js
1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install`

## usage

```console
bin/vtt-translate
```

You'll be prompted to input some info, then you'll save your translated .vtt file somewhere.
